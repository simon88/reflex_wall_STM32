# Reflex wall with STM32

Just a little project with NUCLEO card STM32. Simple reflex wall with LED and push button, test your reflex, enjoy and try not to break the push button :)

## What do you need

For this projet I use STM32F103 this one is on NUCLEO card NUCLEO-F103RB. I made this projetc on Windows 10 x64 and I have used uVision IDE from Keil.
If you don't want to buy NUCLEO card don't worry this projet contains simulate target.

## Informations

I haven't used any kind of library just to learn how STM32 works, I think this is the best way to learn how material works :).
